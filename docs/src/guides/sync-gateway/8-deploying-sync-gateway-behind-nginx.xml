            <introduction>
                <paragraph>In computer networks, a reverse proxy is a type of proxy server that retrieves resources on behalf of a client from one or more servers. These resources are then returned to the client as though they originated from the server itself (or servers themselves).</paragraph>

                                    <paragraph>A reverse proxy can hide the existence of a Sync Gateway server or servers. This can help to secure the Sync gateway instances when your service is exposed to the internet.</paragraph>

                    <body>
                        <paragraph>
                            Connect to the server running Sync Gateway and install the nginx server:
                        </paragraph>
                        <code-block>
                            # sudo apt-get install nginx
                        </code-block>
                        <note type="caution">
                            Sync Gateway requires nginx version 1.3 or later: earlier versions do not support WebSockets, and will cause connection problems with pull replications from Couchbase Lite. On some Linux distros, such as Ubuntu 12.04, apt-get may be configured to install an older version. Run the command <code>nginx -v</code> to check which version was installed. If it's older than 1.3, you can update it with the following shell commands:
                        <code-block>
                              # service nginx stop
                              # add-apt-repository ppa:nginx/stable
                              # apt-get update
                              # apt-get install nginx
                              # nginx -v
                        </code-block>
                        </note>
                        <paragraph>
                            The nginx server should now be running. You can validate this by viewing the URL <code>http://127.0.0.1/</code> in your browser. (Replace 127.0.0.1 with the IP address of your server.) You should see the standard "Welcome to nginx!" page.

                            If you skipped the installation step because your OS already has nginx, make sure it's version 1.3 or later: earlier versions do not support WebSockets, and will cause connection problems for pull replications from Couchbase Lite. Run the command <code>nginx -v</code> to check. If you need to upgrade, see the installation section for instructions.

                            If you installed nginx using the instructions above, then you will create your sync_gateway configuration file in <code>/etc/nginx/sites-available</code>. Create a file in that directory called <code>sync_gateway</code> with the following content:

Change these values if your sync_gateway is configured differently.

                            Couhbase Lite iOS 1.0.3 introduces websocket support for the changes feed, but by default nginx will not upgrade it's connection to Sync Gateway to support websockets. If an iOS client has websockets enabled for the _changes feed it will be unable to to pull replicate from a Sync Gateway behind an nginx reverse proxy.
                            To enable websockets support, update the location block by adding the following two directives.

                            Sync gateway instances have a 'shared nothing' architecture, this means that you can scale out by simply deploying additional Sync Gateway instances. But incoming traffic needs to be distributed across all the instances, ngingx can easily accommodate this and balance the incoming traffic load across all your Sync Gateway instances. Simply add the additional instances to the 'upstream' block as shown below.

                            For production you should get a cert from a reputable Certificate Authority, which will be signed by that authority.
                            For testing you can create your own self-signed certificate, it's pretty easy using the openssl command-line tool and these directions, you just need to run these commands:

                        <paragraph>
                            First create the directory where the certificate and key will be created

                            # sudo mkdir -p /etc/nginx/ssl
                        </code-block>
                        <code-block>
                            # sudo openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 1095 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout /etc/nginx/ssl/nginx.key -out /etc/nginx/ssl/nginx.crt

                        <paragraph>
                            The command is interactive and will ask you for information like country and city name that goes into the X.509 certificate. You can put whatever you want there; the only important part is the field Common Name (e.g. server FQDN or YOUR name) which needs to be the exact hostname that clients will reach your server at. The client will verify that this name matches the hostname in the URL it's trying to access, and will reject the connection if it doesn't.

                            You should now have two files, a certificate in /etc/nginx/ssl/nginx.crt and a key in /etc/nginx/ssl/nginx.key.

                            We will add a new server section to the sync_gateway nginx configuration file to support SSL termination.
